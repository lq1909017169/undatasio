While the10\\\\%\\ncorrection Since mid-May is broadly in-line with the historical norms of most technical\\n bull runs, the six-week market weakness has prompted increasing investor questions\\nabout the strengthof thepolicy put, and concerns regarding a redux of the powerful but\\nshort-livedRe0peningrallyinlate2022/early2023.Empirically,inthe23episodesinthe\\npast 20 years where MSCl China rallied more than20\\\\%, the market almost in all cases\\n(22 out of 23) experienced at least a5\\\\% pullback after entering a technical bull phase.\\nThese corrections averaged12\\\\%by magnitude, and 32 days in duration, although their\\nsubsequent return trajectory varied significantly post the initial retreat, with earnings\\naccrual/upgrades typically taking over from valuation to drive further gains when these\\nupswings transitioned into a fundamental-led cycle. See point 6 for detail.\\nSource:FactSet,MSCl,GoldmanSachsGlobalInvestmentResearch\\n3.All eyes are on the July policy meetings. July will be a hectic month for China\\npolicy watchers: The Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party is scheduled for July\\n15 to 18, followed by the economically-focused Politburo meeting in July, usually\\nconvened end of the month. As detailed in their Third Plenum preview note, our\\neconomists expect the reform focus to be on both containing left-tail risks and growing\\nright-tail potential for China in the \"post-property\" era, with fiscal/tax and land reforms\\npossibly taking the center stage. However, \"big bazooka\" policy surprises that some\\ninvestors have hoped for since the onset of the housing market downturn remain\\nunlikely. Indeed, both onshore and offshore investors we have met in the past month\\nare somewhat disappointed with the policy intensity, efficacy, and momentum since the\\nApril Politburo meeting, and their expectations on additional stimulus and major\\nreform breakthroughs from the July policy meetings are conservative across the\\nbroad. A few clients even expressed concerns about downside policy risks relatingjtol :$\\nconsumption tax hikes and other contractionary fiscal policy (e.g. tax investigation for\\ncorporates).\\n5. A tepid recovery in sentiment and flows. \"What could turn things around?\" was\\nheavilyfeaturedinmanyofourclientconversations,reflectingcontinuedreluctance\\nfrom fundamental investors to underwrite Chinese growth beyond the short term, in our\\nview.However,the+30\\\\%rally(\\\\mathsf{U S S1.5t n}increaseinmarketcap)inthesecondlargest\\nequitymarketgloballyhasmarginallyhelpedreviveinvestorinterestinChinese\\nequity,evidencedbytherisingturnoverinandthestrongSouthboundflowsintothe\\nHong Kong market, and the reopening of the capital market for Chinese corporates in\\n2Q, led by CB issuances.

The \"Returns\" of \"Shareholders\" in China. Despite its outperformance in past few\\nyears, we believe the theme of shareholder returns will continue to produce strong and\\nstable returns for equity investors for five reasons: a) strong policy push and delivery to\\nimprove shareholder returns; b) Additional fiscal revenue for financially-strained\\ngovernments: every 1pp rise in payout ratios could raise fiscal revenue by Rmb23bn; c)\\nChina\\'s ability to return cash to shareholders looks promising——low payout ratios (30\\\\%+)\\nbut with record-high cash balances (Rmb18tn) and free cashflows (FY23: Rmb2.6tn); d)\\nstable dividend incomes are attractively priced in China where rates are falling; and, e)\\nlikelystructural demand forstableincomesfrom domesticinstitutionalinvestors.We\\nconstruct a China Shareholder Returns Portfolio, which consists of 3 broad equity\\ncohorts-StableCashCows,Dividend/buybacksurprisecandidates,andSelect\\nexpected togenerate3\\\\%shareholder return yields and5\\\\%FCF yields in 2024 on16\\\\%\\ncash/marketcapratioatmedianstock.\\nWe, Kinger Lau, CFA, Timothy Moe, CFA, Si Fu, Ph.D. and Kevin Wang, CFA, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately\\nreflect our personal views, which have not been influenced by considerations of the firm\\'s business or client relationships.\\nUnless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs\\' Global Investment Research division.\\nSee company-specific regulatory disclosures above for any of the following disclosures required as to companies referred to in this report: manager or\\nco-manager inapendingtransaction;\\\\uparrow\\\\%or other ownership; compensation for certain services; types of client relationships; managed/co-managed\\npublic offeringsinpriorperiods; directorships;for equitysecurities, market making and/orspecialistrole.GoldmanSachs trades or maytrade as a\\nprincipal indebtsecurities(or inrelatedderivatives)ofissuersdiscussed in thisreport.\\nThe following are additional required disclosures: Ownership and material conflicts of interest: Goldman Sachs policy prohibits its analysts,\\nprofessionals reporting to analysts and members of their households from owning securities of any company in the analyst\\'s area of coverage.\\nAnalyst compensation: Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Goldman Sachs, which includes investment banking revenues.
